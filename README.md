# Learning Challenges

This repo contains exercises and projects of varying scope that anyone
can use to learn the fundamentals through repeatable practice following
a process something like the following:

1. Read the challenge to identify what needs to be learned
2. Research what needs to be learned and write about it in own words
3. Experiment with different ways to fulfill the challenge
4. Repeat until mastery

Where and how to learn the required skills, knowledge, and abilities is
left to the learner to decide since such determination is a core part of
the learning process itself since each person learning is an individual with
different learning considerations and constraints.

Challenges can be used later as a method of review, self-assessment, and
friendly competition with oneself and others.

## Language Agnostic

Challenges that involve programming are usually not language specific so
that the same challenge can be applied to learn several language as well
as to compare and contrast them with one another. Some may find value in
learning two or three language simultaneously (the polyglot approach).

## No Solutions Here

No solutions to these challenges are provided in this repo. This is by
design. Participants are encouraged to share their solutions with one
another and to seek the help of an experienced mentor. Every solution
will be different to some degree, which should be embraced and
encouraged in order to promote "hacker think" and innovation.
